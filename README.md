Aditya Khandelwal's Resume
# Big Tech
1. Microsoft Shopping
    > Pioneered GPT3-powered Smart-Compare Proof of Concept in Bing Chat, reimagining product comparison; scaled data pipeline to ~10M products/day in a resource-constrained setting; collaborated with key senior stakeholders for successful deployment
    
    > Streamlined processing of an ML-powered Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis system by consolidating 5 pipelines across 4 global teams and 2 organizations, resulting in enhanced efficiency (10x processing time reduction) and accuracy (1.8x improvement)
    
    > Led cross-functional effort to expand Product Graph taxonomy (novel way to store ~4B online product listings) by 70x, and show additional filters using it, resulting in ~9% revenue increase for affected listings, and high praise from CVP of Microsoft WebXT
    
    > Developed an Active Learning-based fully automated ML system to find articles with shopping content, boosting Daily Active Users by 5x (200k to 1M); deployed in coordination with relevant organizations, ensuring minimal overlap with existing systems

### Projects Completed
1. [Algorithmic API Generation for SimpleFix](https://github.com/adityak6798/SimpleFIX-API-Algorithmic-Code-Generation)  
    > Used an XML file containing the structure of [FIX Protocol](http://www.quickfixengine.org/) messages to generate code for a higher-level API over [SimpleFix](https://simplefix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
1. [My DL Library](https://github.com/adityak6798/DeepLearning)  
    > Implemented basic Deep Learning concepts from Scratch using NumPy : (ANN, CNN, Optimizers like SGD, AdaGrad and Adam).
1. [Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/adityak6798/TwitterSentimentAnalysis)  
    > A deep learning model to implement Sentiment Analysis by a character-level Convolutional Neural Network, based on the [paper by Xiang Zhang, Yann LeCun and Junbo Zhao](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01626). Model is scaled down to decrease training time and memory usage.
1. [Cryptron Game Playing Bot](https://github.com/adityak6798/xodiabot1)  
    > A bot that plays a game called Cryptron (Xodia's problem statement for Credenz 2017). Uses MiniMax implemented with Alpha-Beta pruning, Iterative Deepening and a Principal-Variation Table.
